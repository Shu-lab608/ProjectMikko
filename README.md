Click New Branch

Name your branch (e.g., feature/add-form)

##üõ† 3. Make Changes to the Code
Once you have your project open:

GitHub Desktop (GUI):
Open your code editor (e.g., VS Code or Sublime Text)

Navigate to your project folder (the folder where you cloned the repo)

Open and edit the necessary files to implement your feature or bug fix

Save the changes in your editor

GitHub Desktop (GUI) Workflow:
GitHub Desktop automatically detects changes in the project.

If you've modified or added new files, you'll see them in the Changes tab on GitHub Desktop.

From this tab, you can review which files have been modified before committing.

##‚úÖ 4. Stage and Commit Changes
GitHub Desktop (GUI):

After editing, go to the Changes tab in GitHub Desktop.

You'll see the list of modified files. Select the files you want to commit by checking the boxes next to them (or just commit all).

In the Summary box, add a commit message (e.g., "Add form validation").

Click Commit to [branch-name] to commit your changes.

Git CLI:
git add .
git commit -m "Your clear commit message"

##üöÄ 5. Push Your Changes
GitHub Desktop (GUI):
Once the commit is made, click Push origin in the top bar to upload your local branch and changes to GitHub.

Git CLI:
git push origin your-branch-name (But it will be always main origin)

##üì© 6. Create a Pull Request (PR)
GitHub Desktop (GUI):

After pushing, GitHub Desktop will show a notification asking you to Create Pull Request

Click the Create Pull Request button, which will open your browser.
